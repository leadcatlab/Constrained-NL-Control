Constrained Nonlinear Control through Driftless Approximations

This respository contains a simple code accompanying the paper "Ignore Drift, Embrace Simplicity: Constrained Nonlinear Control through Driftless Approximations". The code is particular to the second example of the paper, for the forced Van der Pol oscillator, but can be easily modified to suit a user's needs.
